        abstract = "Estimation of traffic density is a fundamental component of an automated traffic evaluation and monitoring system. It estimation can be used in several traffic monitoring and management applications---from identification of congested traffic flow to macroscopic traffic management in any environment. In this paper, we evaluated MobileNet-SSD and faster R-CNN to evaluate parameterized traffic density in any given traffic image. SSD is capable of handling multiple shapes, sizes, and view angles of objects. MobileNet-SSD, an optimized and a faster algorithm for mobiles, is a cross-trained model from SSD to MobileNet architecture. Faster R-CNN adds a region proposal network (RPN) to generate region proposals instead of the selective search algorithm, which adds a significant processing time to R-CC-based models. The RPN uses anchor boxes for object detection. Producing RPN in the network is faster and better optimized to the data. In this study, we pick a specific use case for the application of MobileNet-SSD and faster R-CNN framework. The advantages and shortcomings of the MobileNet-SSD framework and faster R-CNN were analyzed using feeds from multiple traffic cameras and publicly available labeled MIO-TCD dataset. Multiple models of fasterR-CNN were evaluated on both TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.x. Based on the evaluation and a compromise between speed and accuracy, it was finally decided to use faster R-CNN Inception V2 trained on the COCO dataset as the backbone and it was trained on a combination of MIO-TCD localization dataset and manually labeled dataset captured from live camera feeds. The model uses TensorFlow 1.x as the framework.",

  author   = "McCulloch, Warren S and Pitts, Walter",
  abstract = "Because of the ``all-or-none'' character of nervous activity,
              neural events and the relations among them can be treated by
              means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of
              every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of
              more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and
              that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions,
              one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is
              shown that many particular choices among possible
              neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that
              for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another
              net which behaves under the other and gives the same results,
              although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of
              the calculus are discussed.",

In this paper we attempt to improve the understanding of the underlying issues by exploring these problems from an analytical, a geometric and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet effective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal with exploding gradients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients problem. We validate empirically our hypothesis and proposed solutions in the experimental section.  }
